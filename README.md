# DSA-in-Cpp

## Overview
A collection of C++ implementations for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository serves as a learning resource for students and developers looking to understand fundamental DSA concepts through practical examples.

## Data Structures
- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**

## Algorithms
- **Searching**
  - Linear Search, Binary Search, DFS, BFS
- **Sorting**
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Graph Algorithms**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

### Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 filename.cpp -o output
```

### Running Examples
```bash
./output
```

## Code Structure
Each implementation includes:
- Problem description as comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Well-commented code
- Example usage with test cases
